anyone familiar with how Contract.Migrate works? How does it know which script hash to copy the storage of? Do you send the transaction from the previous contracts address?

@jwhollister You add a method within your existing contract and then call that. 

e.g. call 0x036236246g13jg64 with "upgrade", [hexofNewContract]

This is supposed to copy all storage to the new contract hash and then "destroy" the original.
I ran into this issue: https://github.com/neo-project/neo/issues/153 and had to manually destroy my original contract

Contract.Migrate not destroying the original contract · Issue #153 · neo-project/neo
When I invoke this in my contract:
private static bool UpgradeContract(byte[] newScript)
        {
            Runtime.Notify("Starting Upgrade");
            Contract.Migrate(newScript, new byte[]...

oh it is run in the smart contract, I thought you did a syscall like neo-gui does for Neo.Contract.Create
what is Contract an instance of in your example?
I can't find Contract.Migrate
I don't see that in other contracts I've looked at, are those just not upgradable now?
RPX for example

They would not be upgradable as far as I understand
Neo.SmartContract.Framework.Services.Neo.Contract.Migrate should be the full namespace (in C# anyways)

Ty found it
Guess they'll have to do some manual pull of the old contracts storage then if they want to update it(edited)
SamGuy - Today at 9:33 PM
you can manually call Contract.Delete from within a contract

No I mean to get it into the new contract if they didn't build in the upgrade path to a contract that already ran it's ico
